# Mikrotik-Dashboard Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture of the Mikrotik-Dashboard project based on the analysis of the repository at [https://github.com/toke420/Mikrotik-Dashboard.git](https://github.com/toke420/Mikrotik-Dashboard.git).

## Project Structure

The repository structure will be analyzed after cloning. The typical components you might find in such a project include:

### Frontend Components
- User interface components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Dashboard views and widgets
- Data visualization components
- Router configuration interfaces

### Backend Components
- API integration with Mikrotik RouterOS
- Authentication and session management
- Data processing and transformation
- Configuration storage

### Configuration Files
- Router connection settings
- User preferences
- Dashboard layout configurations

## Technology Stack

After cloning and analyzing the repository, we will document the specific technologies used, which likely include:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular)
- **Backend**: Could be PHP, Python, Node.js, or another language
- **API Communication**: Libraries for communicating with the Mikrotik RouterOS API
- **Data Storage**: Database solutions for storing configuration and possibly router data
- **Authentication**: Mechanisms for secure login to both the dashboard and routers

## Communication Flow

The typical communication flow in a Mikrotik dashboard application includes:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - User logs into the dashboard
   - Dashboard authenticates with Mikrotik router(s)

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Dashboard queries router(s) for status information
   - Router(s) respond with requested data
   - Data is processed and formatted for display

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - User can view and modify router configurations
   - Changes are sent to the router(s) via API
   - Results/confirmation is displayed to the user

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Periodic polling of router status
   - Real-time updates for critical information
   - Alerting for important events or thresholds

## Key Components

### Router Communication
How the dashboard communicates with Mikrotik routers, including:
- Authentication mechanisms
- Command formats
- Error handling

### Data Visualization
How router data is presented to the user:
- Charts and graphs
- Status indicators
- Network maps

### Configuration Management
How router configurations are:
- Retrieved from routers
- Presented to users
- Modified and applied back to routers

## Security Considerations

Security aspects that should be considered:
- Secure storage of router credentials
- Encrypted communication with routers
- User authentication and authorization
- Input validation for configuration changes

## Extension Points

Based on the analysis, we will identify potential extension points for adding new features or improving existing ones:
- Additional data visualizations
- Support for more router features
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Integration with other network management tools
