# Mikrotik-Dashboard Development Guide

This guide provides information for developers who want to understand and extend the Mikrotik-Dashboard project. It is based on the analysis of the repository at [https://github.com/toke420/Mikrotik-Dashboard.git](https://github.com/toke420/Mikrotik-Dashboard.git).

## Development Environment Setup

After analyzing the project, we will document the required development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Git for version control
- Programming language and version requirements (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js)
- Web server (if required)
- Database system (if required)
- Development tools and IDEs

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toke420/Mikrotik-Dashboard.git
   cd Mikrotik-Dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Depending on the project type:
   # For Node.js:
   npm install
   # For Python:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # For PHP/Composer:
   composer install
   ```

3. Configure development settings:
   - Create any required configuration files
   - Set up development database
   - Configure router connection settings for testing

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   # Command depends on the project type
   ```

## Project Architecture

After analyzing the codebase, we will document:

- Code organization and structure
- Design patterns used
- Component relationships
- Data flow

## Mikrotik RouterOS API Integration

Understanding how the dashboard integrates with the Mikrotik RouterOS API is crucial:

- List of RouterOS API commands used in the project
- Data mappings between API responses and application models

## Extending the Dashboard

Guidelines for extending the dashboard with new features:

### Adding a New Feature

1. Identify where the feature fits in the existing architecture
2. Create necessary components (frontend and backend)
3. Integrate with RouterOS API if needed
4. Add any required database models or storage
5. Update the UI to include the new feature
6. Create tests for the new functionality

### Modifying Existing Features

1. Identify the components involved
2. Understand the current implementation
3. Make changes while maintaining compatibility
4. Update tests to reflect changes
